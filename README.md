[Beans Server Trello](https://trello.com/b/eCPszybD/beans-gmod)

while you *could* run this on your own server, we will not go out of our way to make this work with any server besides our own. because of the way this addon is made, you will be missing some files in your data/ directory that will cause some things to not work (as intended.)
